Good question. My parents asked me the very same question in the summer of 2016. For the spirit and the context of this email, my parents (and entire family from that matter) come from the thread where "If you have a good job, and a promising career, why would you leave it??"

Here is an email, I wrote to my mother, with my answer to her question "Why do you want to be a software developer?"

The email was written on July 5, 2016, as I was riding the Subway home from work:

**Warning, this is a long read**

One very important thought occurred to me after we hung up and we can discuss it more later.

I was reading one of these articles last month that was one of these "which career is right for you ?" articles.

This one in particular was short and sweet and it said "just ask yourself, when you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grow up?"

And I couldn't think of an answer.

A week or so later I thought of my answer. I wanted to be a baseball player. Well at age 28 I don't think the Mets will take a chance on me. I'm okay with this logic.

So other than a professional athlete, the only other thing I ever truly wanted to be was (that I can think of) an artist. But as a kid I was always turned off by the numerous Picasso books and printings people gave me as a gift. I get this logic is nonsensical, and irrational, but its just how I felt...and to some degree feel that way today about software development. (This is one of the reasons why I have been quietly pursuing this for over a year. I don't want opinions
thrown at me from people who do not fully understand what it is all about. That is why I have asked you not share it with anyone in our family.)

Back to my story, fast forward to college. Studio art was amazing and one of the few regrets I have about college is that somehow, art was not one of my majors or minors.

The continuing education classes at SVA were amazing and I loved them. I continued the passion, on my own, filling
sketchbooks, and covering canvasses. I just wanted to cultivate it as a hobby. Its a great hobby. Post college, I never thought of it as a career.
 
Now, rest assured, I am not thinking of dropping everything and selling my paintings on the street, BUT in software
development and coding, I have found MANY parallels between staring at a blank computer screen, and starting at a blank canvas. In your mind you know what you want, you just have to execute it. And I know I can learn it.

I can now take this passion, and love I have for art, and turn it into a career. I love learning new things believe it or not. If I could get good enough to teach, it I think that would be ideal. But I am just taking this one step at a time, and I want to be great at it.

In conclusion, just to reiterate one point from the phone conversation earlier, I have been researching this alot longer than you are aware. It took me about 3 months to build this website www.christinaandlancesittinginatree.com and I have really not stopped learning new things since then. (So that was approximately 9 months before the wedding.) I have only made you aware of how serious my interest was a few weeks ago in Zaytoons, because I did not want my
thoughts to succumb to bury this dream, just like they were by relatives who used to by me those Picasso books and Van Gogh printings, as a kid, with nothing but the best intentions. Again, I recognize this is irrational, but I can't help but think this way. And I know the reason why I think this way, which we can discuss at another time.

But this is alive for me, and its very real.
